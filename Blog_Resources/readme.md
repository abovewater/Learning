# Blog and Resources.

<details><summary><h4>29 Mar 2020</h4></summary>

In the crazy world that is COVID-19, I've been able to get more into coding that I have in a very long time. I guess for a lot of people this is an extremely trying time. But through this week, I've been trying to collect a number of resources as I start to learn more and more to do with Python. This includes content that is explaining work flow of projects to a number of resources that are currently offering discounts for people effected by COVID-19. I'll list these periodically. Mainly because I want a place to keep all these resources for myself but if anyone stumbles upon this little repo, they too can have access to everything that I've found.
