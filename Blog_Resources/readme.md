# Blog and Resources.

Which language is the best to start with?

This is a question that I think a lot of people who are learning to code struggle with. It is certainly one thing that I am struggling with. Do I continue to learn python or do I switch to JS and work on that because I'll be able make something that is tangible relatively soon rather than plugging away in the command line. 

Python is fun. I really enjoy it. Especially the using it to scrape the web and automate things. The fact is though, I don't have a lot of stuff to use it on. I can't use it for work purposes, so I'm left just plugging away on stuff that is mildly interesting. 

So there is no real point to this post, just that I wanted to download VS code and github on my MBP and make sure that I can work on either the surface or this. And that I haven't done any coding today and I need to spend some time doing some. So I might go and get on treehouse.

In the crazy world that is COVID-19, I've been able to get more into coding that I have in a very long time. I guess for a lot of people this is an extremely trying time. But through this week, I've been trying to collect a number of resources as I start to learn more and more to do with Python. This includes content that is explaining work flow of projects to a number of resources that are currently offering discounts for people effected by COVID-19. I'll list these periodically. Mainly because I want a place to keep all these resources for myself but if anyone stumbles upon this little repo, they too can have access to everything that I've found.

What have I accomplished this week?

- I completed 4 different lessons on Treehouse. Not sure of the amount of time I've spent on there. I'll start to track that.
- Wrote two working scripts in Visual Code studio. A share price web scraper to take the price of a share from Yahoo and a web scraper that retrieves a list of wines from a wine club and creates a CSV file with that list.
- Continued learning of how to use visual code studio and Github as a resource to record my projects and learning.
